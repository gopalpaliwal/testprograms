BESTFIT README

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:
  Makefile has been provided. Please do below to compile program
  --> make
  This should create a binary file (bestfit) which can be run.

Program Description:
Please set the tapspace to 4 for indenting the program files.

The Search method is implemented for an sorted array
 -Array can be ascending or descending array.
    When the array is ascending, the scan starts from the start. 
    If the array is descending, the scan starts from the end.
    Search method internally calls 3 child api's to do the test.
    testEqual tests if the elements are equal. testLessThan tests
    if the array element is lessThan the key and testGreaterThan
    tests if the element is greater than key. Code duplication is
    avoided by properly calling these api's in Search method.

TESTING:
For testing a separate test.c file is provided which implements the
testing infrastructure.
  testMethod can be called with the input array and the expected
  outcome to the doUnitTest method. doUnitTest method internally
  calls the Search method and compares the outcome with the 
  expected results. If results are as expected, the test passes
  else the test fails.
